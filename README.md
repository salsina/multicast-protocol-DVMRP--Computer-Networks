# multicast-protocol-DVMRP--Computer-Networks
using DVMRP algorithm to create a multicast protocol with routers

This project consists of 3 main filee: client.cpp, server.cpp, router.cpp

All the API can be seen using the help command.

Routers and clients can be created and connected to each other. Any client can create a group and the server keeps the track of all the groups so it can show them to other clients.

Any client can join to any group and can send files to other memebers of that group.

Any client can leave any group at any time.

The commiunications are done using named pipes in operating system.
